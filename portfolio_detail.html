                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                  Squirrel is a bank account, controlled by an app, aimed at making managing your money easy. We completely redesigned the onboarding, signup and activation process for their app.
                </p>
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>
                  A number of users had downloaded the app which had a convoluted onboarding and setup process. Users were skipping through this onboarding and consequently, on first using the app, didn't really understand how to use it. The result of this was they never continued using Squirrel.
                </p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p> We took the 3 stage process of onboarding, signup and activation, merging all three in to one combined linear flow, cutting the number of steps, and vastly shortening the copy by augmenting it with icons and diagrams to reduce congintive load of a previously text heavy experince. We were also able to gain the user's trust in using the app and the service by highlithing early on the types of protection their money had by using the familar logos of the bank that was protetcing their money, and the financial standards agency that authorised and regulated Squirrel.</p>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Air France is the French flagship carrier. We were tasked with integrating Air Franceâ€™s in-flight services into a mobile first, responsive website or a native mobile or tablet application.</p>

                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>The current AirFrance app was very limited, offering ticket booking and flight tracking and that was pretty much it. The experience of almost every in-flight service could potetially be improved by somehow integrating it in to the mobile App  so we investigated the services that were currently causing the biggest pain points for both the flyers and the flight attendants. These included the time taken ordering Snacks & Drinks, browsing Entertainment on unresponsive in-seat touch screens and ordering items from the duty free catalogue.</p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>We redesigned the current AirFrance app to integrate dedicated inflight services features including entertainment, food and drink, duty-free shopping, and purchasing wifi.
                </p>
